# Silent-Voice
This project is a real-time sign language to text translator that bridges communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Using computer vision and machine learning, it detects hand gestures from a live camera feed and converts them into readable text, enabling seamless interaction without interpreters.
